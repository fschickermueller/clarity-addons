        <h6>ProgressSpinner changed</h6>
        The progress spinner was refactored so that it meets the specifications of a proper structural directive. There
        is a breaking change because it has now to be used with the * notation. Moreover the old implementation caused memory leaks.
        For usage please have a look at:
